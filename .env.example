# ANTI-BAN CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# These settings help avoid WhatsApp bans by simulating human behavior.
# Adjust based on your WhatsApp account age for optimal safety.

# Account age in weeks - affects rate limits
# Week 1 (new account):    5 msgs/hour,  15 msgs/day - VERY conservative
# Week 2-4 (warming):     15 msgs/hour,  40 msgs/day - moderate
# Month 2+ (8+ weeks):    30 msgs/hour, 150 msgs/day - mature account
#
# WARNING: Setting this higher than actual account age increases ban risk!
ACCOUNT_AGE_WEEKS=4

# Active hours for presence simulation (24-hour format)
# Bot will appear "online" during these hours and "offline" outside them
# Default: 7 AM to 11 PM (typical human usage pattern)
ACTIVE_HOURS_START=7
ACTIVE_HOURS_END=23
